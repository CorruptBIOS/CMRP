# The history of Pinewood Builders
## 2008
### May - November
* Diddleshot and a group of friends founded Pinewood as Pinewood Labs.
* The earliest known games that were built were the Dog Food Factory in September and the ROBLOX Powerplant in October. The power plant was considered to be one of the first power stations ever built on ROBLOX, while the Dog Food Factory was replaced by the classic game Train Demolition.
### November - December
* As a remake of the closed Dog Food Factory, the Bread Factory was open to the public; a large bread-making production line whose sole purpose is feeding a giant noob named Bob. It became known as one of the last existing "feed the noob" places to exist on the Roblox website, as the others have died out.
* Later in December, Pinewood's first headquarters, named Pinewood Labs (2008), a medium-sized building in a similar setting and style to the ROBLOX Powerplant, was opened.
* This very first Pinewood Headquarters building was made into a 'ruined' state for Diddleshot's CRUSH A BUILDING! game.
* List of known games at the time: The Fun Train!, Pinewood BuildersINC Work & Home shop (DIY), ROBLOX Powerplant, Pinewood BuildersINC LABS (CLOSED FOR X-MAS), Pinewood BuildersINC Warehouse., Pinewood BuildersINC HQ.

## 2009
  
### January
* Pinewood Labs was renamed Pinewood Builders, and it was founded as a group with the latter name using the then-newly introduced Groups feature.
### February
* The Pinewood Research Facility (2009) was built. It was a three to four-story, a white building located in a large, relatively hidden compound. A tunnel was reportedly located past a checkpoint which at this time, was a mystery to where it led to.
* A second headquarters was built. It was a much larger compound and was relatively hidden. Not much information is available regarding it at the moment.
### September

* List of known games at the time: Train Smashers... Extreme! (FREE VIP!), ROBLOX Powerplant™ (Favorite!), Underground (More added, still not finished), Newcomer Tutorial, The Old Pinewood Labs, Pinewood Builders Inc™ Meeting Centre, Drive Into A Giant Washing Machine! Badges!, Pinewood Builders Inc™ Research Center, Pinewood Builders Inc HQ™ UPDATE.
### Unknown date ???
* Several facilities were introduced throughout 2009, such as the ROBLOX Laundromat, Pinewood Computer Core, Pinewood Space Station, (2009), the Mega Miners game, and the launch center of Pinewood's Space Shuttle Advantage.

## 2010
  
* Vice President RedDwarfIV introduces Pinewood Metro, an automated train system, which is used at the Pinewood Space Station.
* RedDwarfIV adds several updates to Space Shuttle Advantage.

## 2011
  
* The Pinewood Builders Security Team was established to protect facilities, although its role was merely roleplay at this time.

## 2012
  
### May
* The Jet Engine Test place was built, where it would test the effects of aerodynamics, and whether it was safe to place Robloxians within 10 feet of a jet turbine. Many injuries have been reported in the conduction of this test.
### June
* The new Pinewood Headquarters was opened, featuring a 12-story office building located on an artificial island in the vicinity of Hong Kong.

## 2013
  
### February
* Diddleshot released a major update to the Computer Core, allowing the reactor core to initiate a meltdown. This would give the Security Team a major role in protecting the core from blowing up.
* Throughout 2013 from this point, Pinewood, its facilities, and its divisions began to enter a modernization phase.

## 2014
  
### June
* A promotional video is uploaded to the old PB youtube channel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdFU4poY8vM
### October
* Pinewood News Network is founded by Chuba7 and SuperBen32, later becoming the official media outlet of Pinewood Builders.
### November
* The Pinewood Research Facility reopened after a full renovation of its exterior and interior design. It was now located in the Sahara Desert, with the majority of the facility located underground, and is now directly connected to the Pinewood Computer Core via elevator shafts.
* However, updates would remain stagnant not only for the PBRF but for most of the Pinewood facilities, as Diddleshot himself said he lacked time to do so.
### December

* Parties for both Christmas and New Year were held at PBCC. Christmas party: Video 1 Video 2 New years party: Video 1 Video 2 Video 3 

## 2015
  
### January

### February
* Upon observing several roleplay firefighters performing training and patrols at the Pinewood Computer Core, an unofficial group named Pinewood EMERGENCY was merged into Diddleshot's newly created Pinewood Emergency Team.
* P.E.T. would remain mostly disorganized due to a lack of attention given to it, resulting in its own supervisors and members creating unofficial subgroups that would leave P.E.T. in leadership squabbles.
### March
* The original deadline for the Pinewood Oil Platform missed its first deadline of March 31, 2015.
### April
* Several PBST mid-ranks established a Skype chat group, including more members over time. Trainers and other Pinewood executives would join the said group in the next few months to come.

### December
* A launch trailer for the Pinewood Oil Platform was announced.
* As part of her duties, VP Momolivia imposes managerial policies to keep the directors active within Pinewood, such as activity checks. This results in constant fighting between Director SigmaTech and Momo herself.
